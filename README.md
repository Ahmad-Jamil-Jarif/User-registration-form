# User Registration Form with Animated Background

This project is a simple user registration form enhanced with an animated background. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for form validation and interactivity. The form collects user information such as full name, email, password, gender, date of birth, phone number, country, and agreement to terms, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Animated Background**: Includes dynamic animations for a visually engaging user experience.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Validates fields like email, phone number, and password matching to ensure data integrity.
- **User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback with error messages for invalid inputs and a success message upon successful submission.
- **Loading Spinner**: Displays a spinner during form processing to indicate activity.

## Usage

To use this registration form:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Fill out the form fields.
3. Submit the form. Validation will ensure all fields are correctly filled, and a success message will appear upon completion.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the form and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including responsive design and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation, interactivity, and handling user feedback.
